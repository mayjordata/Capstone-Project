# College Football Team Recommender

## Problem Statement

American Football is a very popular sport in the United States. Two of the biggest leagues that host the sport are the NFL, The National Football League, which is the professional organization that contain 32 teams across the USA, and NCAA College Football, which is the ameatur version of the NFL teams where over 100 Colleges and Universities have a team of student athelethes to compete in the sport. 

These two leagues have similar and contrasting reasons that makes the sport so amazing and competitive. Spectators are generally fans of one and not the other for varying reasons. I would like to make an attempt at bridging that gap. I plan to create a recommender system that recommends a comparitive team to the average NFL fan based off of their favorite NFL team and favorite style of play (offense, defense, passing, etc.)


## Organization - How to use this Repo

In order to follow along properly with this repo, I suggest that you read each notebook in the following order:

* 1b_College Data Collection
* 2_Data Handling & EDA
* 3_Modeling Notebook
* 4_Recommender Notebook


## Executative Summary

My goal I would like to achieve in creating this recommender is to provide teams that have similar production and style of play as their NFL counterparts. If a particular NFL team was a top all around team in terms of offensive and defensive performance, I want my recommender to return similar college teams with this same performance. This will be a challenge, because though NFL and College are playing the same game with very similar rules, they have different levels of production as far as statistical peformance. This is attributed to several factors that we will not dive into thouroughly, but I will try to account for these differences. The most obvious factor, though, is the NFL has more athletic talent so it changes how the game is played compared to college.

### Data Collection

The data I collected was scraped from the website sportsreference.com. This site is comprised of several sites that provides statistics for MANY sports. Their aim is to provide the most complete and accessible statistics that can be found anywhere.

This site works perfectly for me because it has all of the major stats for both college and NFL football dating back to the start of each of those leagues.

I collected offensive and defensive stats for college football dating back to 1985 and those same stats for the NFL dating back to 1970.

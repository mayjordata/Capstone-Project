# College Football Team Recommender

# Problem Statement
---

American Football is a very popular sport in the United States. Two of the biggest leagues that host the sport are the NFL, The National Football League, which is the professional organization that contain 32 teams across the USA, and NCAA College Football, which is the ameatur version of the NFL teams where over 100 Colleges and Universities have a team of student athelethes to compete in the sport. 

These two leagues have similar and contrasting reasons that makes the sport so amazing and competitive. Spectators are generally fans of one and not the other for varying reasons. I would like to make an attempt at bridging that gap. I plan to create a recommender system that recommends a comparitive team to the average NFL fan based off of their favorite NFL team and favorite style of play (offense, defense, passing, etc.)
